This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Why I built this project

It was because I wanted to build something and get to be creative and express myself. This project had so many firsts for me, this style was unique I always wanted to do something similar. From time to time, I love to see apps and websites that have sharp edges and straight lines and punchy, confident and vibrant colors, without sacrificing the experience.

Almost all my experience – both professionally and side projects – I've either experimented with, or implemented (from designers cooler than me :D) styles with round borders, soothing shadows, less vibrant color palettes. So I wanted to try something different.

It was also the first time ever where I created a Hero Section art primarily in SCSS. I've usually used a ready picture asset made by better people.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
